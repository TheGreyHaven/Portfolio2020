				For the past few years I've been
				working as an engineer at Ease, a benefits administration/hr platform. I started on the more backend
				focused forms team as both a team member and interim manager. I then
				transitioned to the frontend team working primarily on the marketing site.

				My first foray into programing was during my time as a free-lance illustrator
				when I was running my own small business. I love to solve challenges of both the
				creative and logical form
				and was elated to discover that software development is a combination of both.
				I spent years running a wedding invitation
				design and production shop while creating scientific illustrations on the side
				(many of which have been published by the world's largest news outlets such as ABC, BBC,
				CBS, NBC, and USA Today). It was exciting and rewarding work but once I discovered programing, I was hooked.
      </p>

				Creativity has been a huge asset in my journey of becoming a software engineer and I'm
				eager to bring my unique perspective to help the right company build great products!
