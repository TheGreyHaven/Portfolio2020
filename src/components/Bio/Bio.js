				For the past few years I've been

				My first foray into programing was during my time as a free-lance illustrator
				when I was running my own small business. I love to solve challenges of both the
				creative and logical form

				design and production shop while creating scientific illustrations on the side
				(many of which have been published by the world's largest news outlets such as
